/*
You are given an array A consisting of N integers. For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N,
we want to count the number of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i].
We say that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that: int[] A = {3,1,2,3,6};
For the following elements:
A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
Write a function: class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A); }
that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of integers representing
the amount of non-divisors.
Result array should be returned as an array of integers.
For example, given int[] A = {3,1,2,3,6} :
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].
